# Smart Attendance System - Testing Guide

## 🧪 Testing the Enhanced Class-wise Attendance System

### Prerequisites
1. Backend server running on `http://localhost:8000`
2. Frontend server running on `http://localhost:3000`
3. Supabase database connected and configured
4. Test user accounts (teacher and student)

## 🔧 Backend API Testing

### 1. Health Check
```bash
# Test basic API health
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/health"
# Expected: {"status":"healthy","message":"Face Recognition API is running","face_recognition_available":true,"supabase_available":true}
```

### 2. Class-wise Analytics API
```bash
# Test analytics endpoint (replace with actual teacher Firebase ID)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/analytics/class-wise?teacher_firebase_id=TEACHER_FIREBASE_ID&start_date=2024-01-01&end_date=2024-12-31"
```

### 3. Attendance Summary API
```bash
# Test attendance summary
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/attendance/summary?teacher_firebase_id=TEACHER_FIREBASE_ID&date=2024-01-15"
```

### 4. Current Slot API
```bash
# Test current slot detection
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/current-slot"
```

## 🎯 Frontend Testing Checklist

### Teacher Dashboard Testing

3. **Analytics Page** (`/teacher/analytics`)
   - ✅ Test time range selector (week/month/semester)
   - ✅ Verify class-wise performance breakdown
   - ✅ Check slot performance indicators
   - ✅ Confirm overall statistics accuracy
   - ✅ Test responsive design on different screen sizes

   - ✅ Test attendance rate calculations
   - ✅ Verify visual progress bars

3. **Attendance Marking**
   - ✅ Test instant attendance with teacher password
   - ✅ Verify face recognition attendance
   - ✅ Check attendance history updates
   - ✅ Confirm class-wise attendance tracking

## 📊 Data Verification Tests

### 1. Attendance Accuracy
- Mark attendance for different classes and slots
- Verify data appears correctly in:
  - Teacher dashboard (real-time updates)
  - Student dashboard (class-wise breakdown)
  - Analytics page (proper aggregation)
  - Reports page (detailed records)

### 2. Class-wise Segregation
- Create multiple classes with different students
- Mark attendance for various slots and dates
- Verify data is properly segregated by class
- Check that teachers only see their own class data

### 3. Slot-based Tracking
- Mark attendance for different time slots
- Verify slot information is captured correctly
- Check slot-wise analytics and breakdowns
- Confirm no duplicate attendance for same slot/day

## 🔍 Edge Case Testing

### 1. Duplicate Attendance Prevention
- Try marking attendance twice for same class/slot/day
- Verify system prevents duplicates
- Check error messages are user-friendly

### 2. Cross-class Validation
- Ensure students can't mark attendance for classes they're not enrolled in
- Verify teachers can only see their own classes
- Test proper authorization and access control

### 3. Time Zone Handling
- Test attendance marking at different times
- Verify IST timezone is used consistently
- Check date boundaries and slot transitions

## 📱 User Experience Testing

### 1. Responsive Design
- Test on desktop (1920x1080, 1366x768)
- Test on tablet (768x1024)
- Test on mobile (375x667, 414x896)
- Verify all components are properly responsive

### 2. Loading States
- Check loading spinners during data fetch
- Verify smooth transitions between states
- Test error handling and recovery

### 3. Navigation Flow
- Test all navigation links and buttons
- Verify breadcrumbs and back navigation
- Check deep linking and URL handling

## 🚨 Error Handling Testing

### 1. Network Errors
- Disconnect internet and test offline behavior
- Verify graceful error messages
- Test retry mechanisms

### 2. Invalid Data
- Submit forms with invalid data
- Test API endpoints with malformed requests
- Verify proper validation and error responses

### 3. Authentication Errors
- Test expired sessions
- Verify unauthorized access prevention
- Check proper redirect to login
