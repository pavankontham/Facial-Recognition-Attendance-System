### 8. Data Flow Verification âœ… VERIFIED
**Class-Based Attendance Flow:**
1. âœ… Teacher creates class â†’ Class assigned to teacher
2. âœ… Students join class â†’ Enrollment recorded
3. âœ… Teacher generates attendance code â†’ Class-specific code created
4. âœ… Student enters code â†’ Validates against specific class
5. âœ… Face recognition â†’ Attendance marked for specific class/slot
6. âœ… Reports generated â†’ Class-filtered data only

### 9. Error Handling âœ… VERIFIED
**Comprehensive Error Management:**
- âœ… API error responses with clear messages
- âœ… Frontend toast notifications for user feedback
- âœ… Database constraint validation
- âœ… Network error handling
- âœ… Face recognition failure handling

**Edge Cases Handled:**
- âœ… Duplicate attendance prevention
- âœ… Expired code handling
- âœ… Invalid face recognition attempts
- âœ… Database unavailability fallbacks

### 10. Security & Data Integrity âœ… VERIFIED
**Security Measures:**
- âœ… Firebase authentication required for all operations
- âœ… API endpoint authorization checks
- âœ… Database RLS policies active
- âœ… Input validation and sanitization
- âœ… Secure face encoding storage

**Data Integrity:**

## Critical Verification Points

### âœ… Class-Based vs General Attendance
**CONFIRMED**: System uses class-based attendance throughout:
- Attendance records require `class_id`
- All reports filter by teacher's classes
- Students see only their enrolled classes
- No general/global attendance functionality

### âœ… Quick Attendance Workflow
**CONFIRMED**: 3-minute timer workflow works correctly:
- Codes expire after 3 minutes
- Face recognition required after code validation
- Class-specific attendance marking
- Proper session management

### âœ… Role-Based Functionality
**CONFIRMED**: Teachers and students have distinct workflows:
- Teachers: Create classes, manage students, generate codes, view reports
- Students: Join classes, mark attendance, view personal history
- No cross-role access or functionality
